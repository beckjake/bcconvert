### bcconvert

Convert ZIP files of FLACs into mp3s, preserving the tags I personally care about:
  - artist
  - album
  - album artist
  - title
  - track number
  - year

It's only designed to work with ZIPs/FLACs downloaded from bandcamp, but it probably works ok with other stuff, I don't know.

This project is mostly so I can fool around with async stuff in python but who knows, maybe someone else wants this.
